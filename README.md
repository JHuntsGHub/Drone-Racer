# Drone Racer
*A physics based racing game by Jack Hunt.*  

## The Game
The player races around a track, flying through hoops in a difficult to master race.

### The Player
* The game is designed to be played with an Xbox controller, but a keyboard works in single player as well.
* Thrust is controlled with right analogue stick.
* Pitch and Roll are controlled with left analogue stick.
* Yaw is controlled with left and right triggers.
* 1st person camera mode and 3rd person mode are activated by pressing the up arrow and down arrow, respectively.

### Multiplayer
* Multiplayer is available in local split screen.
* Each player is controlled with a different controller; it does not support keyboard.

### The Rings
* The game has an atypical take on the racing genre.
* The players race to fly through the highest number of rings which are activated in sequential order.
* There are some booster items off the track that waste the players time but make the points the rings give more valuable.
* The player with the most points wins.

### Extra Mechanics
* I wanted to reward accuracy over blindly bumping around.
* So I implemented a health system. Each crash will damage the player according to how fast they were going.
* The player can make a pitstop to heal up by landing on a healing pad.
* If a player runs out of health, their run is over. This adds a risk/reward element to the game.

## Current State of Project
The project has been finished and I have moved on to another. I copied the repository here to be public for use in my portfolio.
